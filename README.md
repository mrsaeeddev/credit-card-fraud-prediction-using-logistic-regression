# Credit Card Fraud Prediction Using Logistic Regression
## Analysis of Credit card dataset to predict transactions to be fraudulent or valid by identifying fraudulent and legitimate credit card transactions by Machine Learning techniques

## Dataset :
The dataset contains transactions made by European credit card holders in September 2013. This dataset has different parameters recorded anonymously

## Results :
This project focuses on identifying the fraudulent transaction by scammers or intruders in order to block or rectify any future transactions having suspected behavior.
